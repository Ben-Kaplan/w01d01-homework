//infinite Loop?

// yes

//Inifite loop 2

//no it would never run

//while loop would log 20 A's

//for loops accomplish what a while loop does but with a variable and operator contained with in it and on one line of code.

//(the variable; the condition; the counter);

//Section 4

//loop in reverse

//More counting

for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
